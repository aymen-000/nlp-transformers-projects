# Emotion Classification with Transformers

This repository contains the code and resources for building an emotion classification model using the DistilBERT transformer. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset to classify emotions from text data, leveraging the power of pre-trained transformer models. This project is based on the techniques and concepts presented in the book *Natural Language Processing with Transformers*.

## Overview
This project aims to classify text inputs into various emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, and others. The model is built using the Hugging Face Transformers library, and the main focus is on fine-tuning the DistilBERT model to achieve high accuracy in emotion detection.

## Model Architecture
- **Model**: DistilBERT (a smaller, faster, and cheaper version of BERT)
- **Training Techniques**:
  - **Fine-Tuning**: The model was fine-tuned on the specific emotion classification dataset.
  - **Feature Extraction**: Pre-trained embeddings were extracted and used for downstream tasks.
- **Tokenizer**: The DistilBERT tokenizer was used to preprocess the text data.
